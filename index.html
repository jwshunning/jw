      <p>When Anna told her five-year-old son, Karama, that his father, Robert McCoy Sr., would be resurrected from the dead, he did everything to make sure he was there to see it happen. </p>

      <p>If he was obedient, he would get to see the earth transformed into a lush paradise, Anna said. </p>

      <p>His father would be there- along with lions, tigers, and panda bears docile enough for children to play with. His family would be together again. Best of all, this time everyone would be immortal and without flaw.</p>

      <p>On December 5, 2017, 37 years after Robert’s murder, ten red letters perched in view of the Brooklyn Bridge transformed to crimson against the night sky one last time. The following day, the 15-foot letters which spelled WATCHTOWER, were removed
        after more than 40 years on the city’s skyline. </p>

      <p>For Robert’s widow, Anna, and more than 8 million people worldwide, the Watchtower sign and the series of buildings it marked was something of a mecca. They called it Bethel, a word that means “House of God.” </p>

      <p>The Watch Tower, Bible, and Tract Society, the incorporation of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, sold their headquarters that bore the iconic Watchtower sign to Donald Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner’s development company for $340 million dollars last year.
        Another property on the same block was sold in August for $18 million, and another for $87.5 million. </p>

      <p>The corporation has paid millions in settlements to victims of sexual abuse, but a Pew Research study states that nearly half of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the U.S. live on less than $30,000 a year. Only nine percent have an undergraduate degree, the
        lowest percentage among similar religious groups.</p>

      <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses may only call to mind a set of rigid rules or an unexpected knock on the door from friendly Bible toters claiming to be neighbors,  but their practice of shunning isn’t as innocuous. It is called disfellowshipping, and the application
        stings hundreds of ex-Jehovah’s Witnesses and their families every year. The reasons vary, but the emotional headwinds for former members as they recover from the trauma of losing the only community they have known rests in the uncomfortable terrain
        between the grief of death and the joy of discovering a new existence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="story" id="first">
      <h1>IN THE BEGINNING</h1>
      <p>Charles Taze Russell, a restorationist Christian minister, founded the group in Pennsylvania in the 1880s. They went by the name “Bible Students” as they distributed material written by Russell and printed by his publishing company, “The Watch Tower
        Bible and Tract Society.” </p>

      <p>Using a literal interpretation of the Bible, Russell predicted the world would end in a war called Armageddon. He also used a mathematical formulation based on an ancient Hebrew calendar to determine that 1874 was the year when Christ would return
        to rule. Christ’s rule would signal the beginning of Armageddon, which would come to pass in 1914.</p>

      <span class="topsb"></span>
      <p>When Russell died, he was succeeded by an eccentric attorney named Joseph Rutherford, nicknamed “Judge.” After Russell’s prediction for the end of the world did not come to pass, Rutherford made a new prediction. Instead of 1874, 1914 would be the
        year. The former trial lawyer also believed Old Testament prophets would return to earth and live in a mansion he built in San Diego called Beth Sarim. </p>

      <p>Six years after Russell’s death, Rutherford proposed a name change to roaring crowd at a convention on a warm day in early autumn 1922. The Bible Students became Jehovah’s Witnesses. </p>

      <h1>THE ART OF THE BUBBLE</h1>
      <p>They do not celebrate any holidays, including birthdays, Christmas, and Easter. They do not salute the flag, serve in the military, or accept blood transfusions. But these distinct rules are really the only things that set Jehovah’s Witnesses apart.
      </p>

      <p>No bloodline ties them, and they don’t don a particular style of dress. They don’t live in cordoned communities. In the U.S., they are almost equally racially and ethnically mixed among whites, African Americans, and Latinos.  </p>

      <p>But the isolation is insidious. Articles in Watchtower and Awake! Magazines published by the organization warn members to limit association with non-witnesses, including family members. Separation happens naturally because the time commitment to
        door-to-door preaching, along with employment or school, does not leave room for much else. </p>

      <p>“Jehovah’s Witnesses have perfected the art of keeping you in a mental bubble. They don’t ask people to live in separate quarters, but they have ways of keeping you isolated anyway,” said Ruben Ortiz, a former witness from the Bronx.   </p>

      <h1>A KNOCK ON THE DOOR</h1>

      <p>There are approximately 8.3 million Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide, and they have preaching missions in 240 locations around the globe. Here’s how a person usually gets involved:

        <p class="jw-steps">
          <p>1. A Jehovah’s Witness knocks on your door. You like what you hear and invite him/her back to learn more. </p>

          <p>2. The witness returns and offers you a Bible study. You accept.</p>

          <p>3. You begin to attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall, the JW place of worship. </p>

          <p>4. After some time, you are allowed to go out and do some preaching of your own. When you go out and preach, you become what is known as a “publisher.” You are expected to put in around 3 hours per week. </p>

          <p>5. You’re a good publisher and make your hourly requirements and attend all of the weekly meetings, so you decide to get baptized. You have made a lifelong commitment to the Jehovah’s Witnesses to practice all of their teachings and fulfill
            the tenets of service.</p>
        </p>

        <p>Besides the people who converted in the way outlined above, about a third of Jehovah’s Witnesses were indoctrinated as children, also known as being “born in” the faith.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Members are required to attend multiple weekly meetings, to study the Bible and various assigned publications, and to “evangelize actively among friends, neighbors, and strangers,” according to David Voas, a sociologist of religion at the University
          College London.  The weekly time commitment, which includes preaching, two meetings, meeting preparation, and other activities is around 10 hours for the average Jehovah’s Witness.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The witnesses believe that when people die, they simply return to the earth. Heaven is only for a select number, and there is no hell other than the grave. </p>

        <p>At a future date, God, called Jehovah, will destroy non-believers and the earth will be restored to the paradise Adam and Eve lost in the book of Genesis. </p>

        <p>The earth will be populated by Jehovah’s Witnesses whose bodies have been restored to perfection- no sickness, no death. They will live to time eternal.</p>

    <div class="story">
      <p>Waiting for life in the paradise, as witnesses call the earth’s future transformation, makes a mirage of life in this world. As they anticipate endless life under a theocracy, the notion of going to college or pursuing a career recedes into the
        background- a distracting distortion of the pursuits of “worldly people,” JW jargon for unbelievers. Though they maintain a respectful relationship with secular authority, congregation authority sometimes collides with the law in unexpected ways.</p>
      <p>When ex-JW Ruth Anne Whicher’s childhood friend, Georgia, went missing, her father, an elder in the congregation, led a squad of congregation members in search of the body. Six weeks later, a fellow Jehovah’s Witness was charged with Georgia’s rape
        and murder. During the search, Ruth Anne’s older brother got into a serious car accident and required a blood transfusion. </p>

      <p>Ruth Anne’s father saw his son near death, and made the difficult decision of going against JW doctrine by accepting a blood transfusion for his son. Instead of grappling with the repercussions of discovering a murderer and rapist in their midst,
        the congregation disfellowshipped Ruth Anne’s father.</p>

      <p>If a Jehovah’s Witness commits what is deemed “a serious sin” and does not express sufficient repentance, they are to be excommunicated, according to an article published in the August 2015 Watchtower magazine. The article, which calls disfellowshipping
        “a loving provision” offers the most recent explanation of the practice, which was instituted in 1952.  </p>

      <p>Serious sins include engaging in premarital sex, smoking cigarettes, and marital infidelity, but there is no exhaustive list. Offenses encompass acts that range from watching pornography to getting a tattoo. </p>
      <p>When a person has confessed the act, but does not appear to be sufficiently repentant- a subjective process, up to the discernment of congregation elders-the person is then disfellowshipped. </p>
      <h2>AT HOME AND DISFELLOWSHIPPED</h2>
      <p>If an adult is disfellowshipped, the repercussions are straightforward. But when a young person who still lives with parents is excommunicated, the family often ends up dancing an invisible line drawn between the rooms of the family home, around
        the dining table, in the hallways. The intention is to make to the offending person feel shame, but the rituals of family life and the practicalities of living under the same roof complicate the mission. </p>

      <p>When Debbie Depuis was invited to go for ice cream, her mother refused to let her go because the invitation was from an unbeliever. Debbie snapped. All the years of having her life micromanaged by the organization flashed before her “in an instant,”
        Debbie said. </p>

      <p>“Well I’m not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,” she told her mother before leaving with her friend. </p>

      <p>Her mother heard the statement as a battle cry. She alerted Debbie’s father. When Debbie returned home that evening, a group of congregation elders was waiting for her. They used scriptures to try to bring Debbie back to her senses, but to no avail.
        Her mind was made up.</p>

      <p>Soon after, she was disfellowshipped. Debbie’s mother beat her younger sister who was 11-year-old for sneaking into Debbie’s room to speak to her. </p>

      <p>Violeta Rios Dias felt lucky. She had a happy childhood as a Jehovah’s Witness. Her parents allowed to go to college. </p>

          LISTEN TO Violeta DESCRIBE HER CHILDHOOD AS A JW (Happy memories clip)
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>“I wasn’t one of those Jehovah’s Witnesses whose parents didn’t let them go to college. My parents valued education,” she said from her office in Santiago, Chile. </p>

      <p>She’s now a  in Santiago. She remembers traveling around the country preaching with her aunts and uncles who were special pioneers, as people who ___ are called.</p>

      <p>But during her first year of college, when she still lived in the family home, Violeta fell in love with a non- Jehovah’s Witness classmate. </p>

      <p>For Jehovah’s Witnesses, dating is the first step of marriage and should only be done with marriage vows in mind.  Dating outside of the organization is forbidden. When a Jehovah’s Witness couple dates, they are to be accompanied by a chaperone.
      </p>

      <p>n a Skype call last month, she recalled the first kiss they shared. “It was supposed to be a beautiful experience, but I felt so guilty,” she said. </p>

      <p>As a matter of fact, her entire time dating him was marred by a sinking feeling of doom mixed with self loathing. She was living a double life, hiding their relationship from her parents. When she spent nights with him, she told her parents she
        was with a Jehovah’s Witness friend. When another Jehovah’s Witness saw Violeta with her boyfriend, he gave her two months to come clean. </p>

      <p>When she confessed to the elders in the congregation, the judiciary committee decided to disfellowship her. Because she still lived with her parents, the family was in a precarious situation. As a disfellowshipped family member, relatives who lived

      <p>Mona Miller constantly felt like she was on the edge of disaster. As a Jehovah’s Witness in the 1970s, her family believed Armageddon would come in 1975, the next year that the organization prophesied for the great war, and they were always on alert.

          Mona Miller 1975 clip </p>
      </div>


      <p>Growing up in eastern Oregon, Mona Miller wondered why people who seemed like otherwise good people, but who weren’t believers were going to die in Armageddon. </p>

      <p>After her father died when she was a teenager, she began working at a grocery store to help support her mother. While she pioneered at intervals and worked part time, she was constantly reprimanded by elders for working on nights when she was supposed
        to be at Kingdom Hall meetings.</p>

      <p>When Mona was 24, a man in a cowboy hat came to the grocery store where she worked and a casual flirtation ensued. After eight months of only seeing each other in the grocery store, the man came to Mona’s house and formally asked permission to date
        her. Mona’s mother couldn’t allow her to date anyone who wasn’t a witness, but then they came up with an idea. What if the man studied to become a Jehovah’s Witness? </p>

      <p>Mona was allowed to date him under this guise. Mona’s mother accompanied them as a chaperone on their dates, but congregation elders found the relationship inappropriate. One day, they brought Mona in to be reprimanded and threatened to disfellowship
        her if the relationship continued. Mona knew she had committed no sin because all of her dates were chaperoned. Dreading the shame disfellowshipping would cause her mother, Mona drove to a cliff and contemplated suicide. </p>

      <p>“I kept thinking if I killed myself, my mother would never forgive me for not talking to her about it first,” said Mona. </p>

      <p>Mona said an elder also threatened her relationship with her mother.</p>

      <p>But her mother wrote a letter to headquarters asking about Mona’s case. A few weeks later, she got a reply saying that Mona had not committed a disfellowshipping offense. But the whole ordeal poked holes in Mona’s faith and she stopped going to
        meetings. Soon after, her brother told her he could no longer speak to her.</p>

        off, he watched from a distance and marveled at “how old they looked.” They had emailed him a few days earlier asking that he not try to speak to them. </p>

      <p>Disfellowshipping among Jehovah’s Witnesses is a means to maintain a strong sense of membership, according to religious sociologists, Rodney Stark and Laurence Iannaccone.</p>

      <p>In their 1997 paper, “Why The Jehovah’s Witnesses Grow So Rapidly: A Theoretical Application,” published in the Journal of Contemporary Religion, they praise Jehovah’s Witnesses as “the fastest growing sect in the world.” </p>

      <p>Their projections for the growth rate of Jehovah’s Witnesses were later discredited, but their research on what they call “the success of the organization” is still largely cited among religious studies scholars. They attribute the growth of the
        organization, in part, to the practice of disfellowshipping.</p>

      <p>Stark and Iannoccone argue that If an organization is strict, it increases the value of membership by weeding out “free-loaders,” their term for people who do not fulfill their share of the work membership requires. Disfellowshipping creates a sense
        of solidarity and members know that their commitment has value, they state.  </p>

      <p>But it is not only people who do not carry out their share of the required ministry who are shunned.</p>

      <p>Karen Wilson, 55, from Spokane Washington, was a pioneer, a Jehovah’s Witness who does the preaching work full-time, when she was disfellowshipped. Wilson was physically abused by her husband. When she went to the elders, instead of the police,
        she was told that she should be a more “submissive” wife.</p>

      <p>“A lightbulb went off in my head. Why would God have created me, if I was only supposed to be beaten up by my husband?”, said Wilson.</p>

      <p>Wilson was an active and devoted Jehovah’s Witness who shunned her mother because it was mandated by the organization, yet she was not protected from shunning when she escaped an abusive spouse.</p>

      <p>“Shunning and being shunned devastates you. It tears you apart. It doesn’t strengthen anything,” said Wilson.</p>

      <p>Cheryl Ching, a family therapist and licensed social worker based in Brooklyn, bases her philosophy, in part, on the idea that “family is connected even if there is a disconnect. There is a kind of continuing influence, whether the people are there
        in front of them or not.” </p>
      <h1>THE GRAY AREA</h1>
      <p> Another truism is that shunning happens on a spectrum. The organization may mandate that family members and friends cut off communication, but individual members sometimes choose to speak to their loved one who is disfellowshipped in small amounts.
      </p>

      <p>The underlying fear of witnesses, though, is that by speaking to the disfellowshipped person, the believer may be punished. Choosing to speak to a disfellowshipped person is complicated. And sometimes, even after years of being in contact with an
        ex-Jehovah’s Witness, a person may choose to suddenly withdraw contact altogether.</p>

      <p>A discourse given at the 2017 three-day Jehovah’s Witness convention announced that even if a person is not disfellowshipped, if he/she no longer attends meetings, the person should be shunned.</p>

      <p>Chayla Gibson’s parents who had spoken to her everyday for ten years even after she stopped attending meetings heard the discourse at the Cow Palace in San Francisco. Within a month, they visited Chayla and told her that they could no longer speak
        to her. </p>

    <div class="story">
      <p> Andrea Rota, a professor in the Sociology of Religion at The Universities of Bern and Fribourg in Switzerland, whose research focuses on Jehovah’s Witnesses, does not like to use the term “controlling” when discussing the influence the organization
        exerts on members’ lives. </p>

      <p>“When you say control, it negates the fact that many witnesses choose to stay and are quite happy with the sect,” he said. </p>

      <p>Rota pointed out that there are Jehovah’s Witnesses who practice while maintaining a sense of freedom to do as they choose in the privacy of their homes, even if their actions violate religious rules. </p>

      <p>“I know Jehovah’s Witnesses who are faithful, but they may choose to watch an “R” rated movie at home, but they won’t talk about it with other witnesses,” Rota said. </p>

      <p>Rota thinks the disparity is not unique and likens it to a commitment that one may make to an institution without personally enjoying all aspects of the commitment.</p>
      <p>A 25-year-old Jehovah’s Witness from South Carolina, who chose to remain anonymous, agreed. “You just do what you have to do. I don’t think having a tattoo is wrong, but I’d cover it when I go to the [Kingdom] hall,” she said.</p>

      <p>But to Chayla, her parents shun her because they feel obligated to. </p>

    <div class="story">
      <p>Matthew was raised as a Jehovah’s Witness, but he found that by his late teens, he couldn’t quell his curiosity about church. As a witness, churches are forbidden parts of “Christendom,” a JW catch-all word for Christian denominations. Compared
        to churches in the African American tradition, in particular, Kingdom Halls are somber places. Songs are sung to pre-recorded music with no percussion. Attendees sing in unison; there is no choir and there are no solos. Members stand at their
        seats to sing and quietly sit when the songs, known at kingdom melodies, are over. </p>

      <p>Matthew took his questions about church to two women co-workers. One of them told him she was directing a gospel play and asked Matthew to audition. As a child, Matthew would have never imagined that one day he would be in a church, or performing
        in a gospel play, no less. </p>

      <p>“I was good at it!,” he said, reliving the initial joy almost 20 years later. </p>

      <p>When he was 21-years-old, a few months after acting in the gospel play, he stopped attending the Kingdom Hall.</p>

      <p>“God called me out of it,” he told his Jehovah’s Witness mother, after months of going to a church without telling her.   </p>

      <p>Their relationship was severed.</p>

      <h1>RECOVERY</h1>
      <p>Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005 when Karama Sadaka was 30-years-old. He had only recently left the Jehovah’s Witnesses and he thought that the storm was Armageddon. Completely disoriented, he feared that he was on the wrong side of the
        war he been raised to believe would end the world.</p>

      <p>He was married with two young daughters, but when he told his wife he no longer agreed with the Jehovah’s Witnesses, she put him out. He wandered around New Orleans until FEMA relocated him to Nashville. Away from New Orleans and the only religion
        he had ever known, he saw an opportunity to start fresh. </p>

      <p>“There were so many things I had to learn about the world. Sometimes I feel like I’m a baby,” said Sadaka. </p>

      <p>After a stint in Nashville, he moved to NYC where he eventually got involved in an ex-Jehovah’s Witness recovery group, founded by Ruben Ortiz. </p>

      <p>Sadaka remembers the promise of seeing his father again in paradise, but he’s worked hard to re-program his thoughts and help people who are still in the organization by producing a YouTube series called “Witness the Drama.” </p>

      <p>Today, he lives in Miami where he is training to be a life coach. </p>

      <p>Some former Jehovah’s Witness opt to return their family’s shunning by not accepting occasional phone calls or otherwise cold treatment.</p>

      <p>Cheryl Ching, the therapist in Brooklyn, says that her process with each client is based on how the individual defines the relationship. </p>

      <p>“It’s important to feel that sense of power, that it is possible to have a relationship that’s based on your terms,” Ching says.  In other words, it’s important to for the person to feel that they’re not always a victim of the group, at the mercy

      <p>Cruz was sexually abused by her father, a Jehovah’s Witness, from the time she was six to 16-years-old. When it came out that her father had abused 15 other girls, the congregation excused his actions and he was unpunished. </p>

      <p>“I never could do a double life. I didn’t believe everything, but I couldn’t leave because my family was in,” said Cruz. </p>

      <p>After she left her family’s home, she continued practicing, but she couldn’t get over the hypocrisy she saw, she said. She also never forgave her family, particularly her mother, for not taking action when they found out she was being sexually abused.</p>

      <p>Like Debbie Depuis, Mercedes’ doubts about the religion began early. She was baptized when she nine-years-old. By the time she was 14, Mercedes started being homeschooled, which allows young people to pioneer, a choice common among Jehovah’s Witnesses.
        Her mother imagined that Mercedes was on a spiritual track to Bethel, but Mercedes was leading a “double life.” </p>

      <p>She had romantic feelings for another girl in the Kingdom Hall. She began visiting chat rooms.</p>

      <p>“I started to feel like there was a struggle in me. Like there was something more out there for me,” she said.</p>

      <p>She ended up getting involved with a man she met online almost 10 years older than she was. She tried to end the relationship when she realized “it was toxic and he was controlling,” she said.</p>

      <p>But then he showed up to her Kingdom Hall pretending to be interested in becoming a witness, a move that earned him the blessings of her mother and congregation elders. Then, he got verbally abusive and began following her everywhere. She had nowhere
        to turn. </p>

      <p>The man told Mercedes that he wanted to officially become a witness by getting baptized but he needed to confess to the elders that he and Mercedes had slept together. </p>

      <p>After the confession, Mercedes was disfellowshipped. The shunning put Mercedes on the brink of an emotional collapse. The man began spreading rumors about Mercedes in the Kingdom Hall. When Mercedes complained that she was being harassed, “the basic
        attitude was ‘what did I expect? That’s what you get for having sex’ ” she said. </p>

      <p>After she was reinstated, she moved from her mother’s house and began to fade. But she felt afraid for years, wondering “What if this really is the truth?” </p>

      <p>She started to date an English professor who inspired her to travel and challenged her old beliefs. After beginning therapy, she realized that helping someone else would aid her recovery.</p>

      <p>She formed a meetup group for former Jehovah’s Witnesses in Miami. </p>

      <p>“The only encouragement there is to think for yourself. Find your own voice,” she said of the group’s philosophy.</p>
      <h1>THE WAY FORWARD</h1>
      <p> Former Jehovah’s Witnesses have carved out roads to recovery from the psychological damage of being in the organization. Social media groups and websites dedicated to helping ex Jehovah’s Witnesses can be found all over the internet, buzzing with
        heart wrenching stories of families torn apart and users offering words of encouragement to each other.</p>

      <p>There are also stories of joy. This year, Deb D’Agostino’s mother, a 99-year-old Jehovah’s Witness, decided to celebrate her birthday for the first time. </p>

      <p>Dan Adams fell in love with another former Jehovah’s Witness, Amy, who he met in an online recovery group. They got married last year. </p>

      <p>Karen Wilson now enjoys a rich relationship with her mother, who she shunned for __ years.</p>

      <p>Like so many victims of systemic trauma, they had chosen paths - treacherous, winding, and unpredictable- to recovery. And somewhere on the way, they chose to speak out.  </p>

            <h1>What is disfellowshipping?</h1>
            <p>If a Jehovah’s Witness commits what is deemed “a serious sin” and does not express enough repentance, they are to be excommunicated, according to an article published in the August 2015 Watchtower magazine. The article, which calls disfellowshipping
              “a loving provision” offers the most recent explanation of the practice, which was instituted in 1952. </p>
