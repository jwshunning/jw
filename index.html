      <p class="beginning">When Anna Easterling told her five-year-old son, Karama, that his father, Robert McCoy Sr., would be resurrected from the dead, he did everything to make sure he was there to see it happen. </p>

      <p>If he was obedient, he would get to see the earth transformed into a lush paradise, Anna said. </p>

      <p>His father would be there- along with lions, tigers, and panda bears docile enough for children to play with. His family would be together again. Best of all, this time everyone would be immortal and without flaw.</p>

      <p>On December 5, 2017, 37 years after Robert’s murder, ten red letters perched in view of the Brooklyn Bridge transformed to crimson against the night sky one last time. The following day, the 15-foot letters which spelled WATCHTOWER, were removed
        after more than 40 years on the city’s skyline. </p>

      <p>For Robert’s widow, Anna, and more than 8 million people worldwide, the Watchtower sign and the series of buildings it marked was something of a mecca. They called it Bethel, a word that means “House of God.” </p>

      <div class="bio">
        <p class="begbio">Karama Sadaka was born New Orleans in 1975. But besides the warm weather, he says he has no happy memories of growing up in the city. “We didn’t go to parades. We didn’t do Mardi Gras, we didn’t eat king cake...nothing that made the city fun did
          we do,” he said. </p>

        <p>By the time he was five, his mother, a recently converted Jehovah’s Witness, was becoming more deeply involved with the organization. The resurrection teaching drew her, especially after her husband, Karama’s father, was murdered. Karama had occasionally
          gone to the meetings at the Kingdom Hall with her, but when his father was killed, he began to believe that seeing him again was dependent upon his being a good Jehovah’s Witness. His watched his life change into a series of new rules, but he
          didn’t question them. He just focused on seeing his father again. “I went to school not understanding why people would laugh when I said I’d see my dad again soon,” he said. </p>

        <p>Karama eventually got married to another Jehovah’s Witness and had two daughters. But his non-JW uncle would sometimes ask questions that stoked doubts. One day, his uncle asked if he would let his daughter die if she required a blood transfusion.
          Karama said that he wouldn’t. Later, Karama posed the same question to his wife. “Of course! We’ll see her again in the paradise,” his wife said. After doing research online, he confided in his wife that he believed that they were in cult. His
          wife then stopped talking to him. When Hurricane Katrina hit a short while later, he thought it was Armageddon. He now lives in Miami where he’s training to become a life coach. He also produces a YouTube series called “Witness The Drama” with
          stories of ex-JWs and information for people who want to leave the organization. </p>

    <div class="story">
      <p>The Watch Tower, Bible, and Tract Society, the incorporation of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, sold their headquarters that bore the iconic Watchtower sign to Donald Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner’s development company for $340 million dollars last year.
        Another property on the same block was sold in August for $18 million, and another for $87.5 million. </p>

      <p>The corporation has paid millions in settlements to victims of sexual abuse, but a Pew Research study states that nearly half of Jehovah’s Witnesses in the U.S. live on less than $30,000 a year. Only nine percent have an undergraduate degree, the
        lowest percentage among similar religious groups.</p>

      <p>Jehovah’s Witnesses may only call to mind a set of rigid rules or an unexpected knock on the door from friendly Bible toters claiming to be neighbors,  but their practice of shunning isn’t as innocuous. It is called disfellowshipping, and the application
        stings hundreds of ex-Jehovah’s Witnesses and their families every year. The reasons vary, but the emotional headwinds for former members as they recover from the trauma of losing the only community they have known rests in the uncomfortable terrain
        between the grief of death and the joy of discovering a new existence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="story" id="first">
      <h1>IN THE BEGINNING</h1>
      <p>Charles Taze Russell, a restorationist Christian minister, founded the group in Pennsylvania in the 1880s. They went by the name “Bible Students” as they distributed material written by Russell and printed by his publishing company, “The Watch Tower
        Bible and Tract Society.” </p>

      <p>Using a literal interpretation of the Bible, Russell predicted the world would end in a war called Armageddon. He also used a mathematical formulation based on an ancient Hebrew calendar to determine that 1874 was the year when Christ would return
        to rule. Christ’s rule would signal the beginning of Armageddon, which would come to pass in 1914.</p>

      <span class="topsb"></span>
      <p>When Russell died, he was succeeded by an eccentric attorney named Joseph Rutherford, nicknamed “Judge.” After Russell’s prediction for the end of the world did not come to pass, Rutherford made a new prediction. Instead of 1874, 1914 would be the
        year. The former trial lawyer also believed Old Testament prophets would return to earth and live in a mansion he built in San Diego called Beth Sarim. </p>

      <p>Six years after Russell’s death, Rutherford proposed a name change to roaring crowd at a convention on a warm day in early autumn 1922. The Bible Students became Jehovah’s Witnesses. </p>

      <h1>THE ART OF THE BUBBLE</h1>
      <p>They do not celebrate any holidays, including birthdays, Christmas, and Easter. They do not salute the flag, serve in the military, or accept blood transfusions. But these distinct rules are really the only things that set Jehovah’s Witnesses apart.
      </p>

      <p>No bloodline ties them, and they don’t don a particular style of dress. They don’t live in cordoned communities. In the U.S., they are almost equally racially and ethnically mixed among whites, African Americans, and Latinos.  </p>

      <p>But the isolation is insidious. Articles in Watchtower and Awake! Magazines published by the organization warn members to limit association with non-witnesses, including family members. Separation happens naturally because the time commitment to
        door-to-door preaching, along with employment or school, does not leave room for much else. </p>

      <p>“Jehovah’s Witnesses have perfected the art of keeping you in a mental bubble. They don’t ask people to live in separate quarters, but they have ways of keeping you isolated anyway,” said Ruben Ortiz, a former witness from the Bronx.   </p>

      <h1>A KNOCK ON THE DOOR</h1>
      <span class="tsb"></span>
      <p>There are approximately 8.3 million Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide, and they have preaching missions in 240 locations around the globe.
        <p class="involve">Here’s how a person usually gets involved:</p>

        <div class="jw-steps">
          <p class="begbio">1. A Jehovah’s Witness knocks on your door. You like what you hear and invite him/her back to learn more. </p>

          <p class="begbio">2. The witness returns and offers you a Bible study. You accept.</p>

          <p class="begbio">3. You begin to attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall, the JW place of worship. </p>

          <p class="begbio">4. After some time, you are allowed to go out and do some preaching of your own. When you go out and preach, you become what is known as a “publisher.” You are expected to put in around 3 hours per week. </p>

          <p class="begbio">5. You’re a good publisher and make your hourly requirements and attend all of the weekly meetings, so you decide to get baptized. You have made a lifelong commitment to the Jehovah’s Witnesses to practice all of their teachings and fulfill
            the tenets of service.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Besides the people who converted in the way outlined above, about a third of Jehovah’s Witnesses were indoctrinated as children, also known as being “born in” the faith.</p>

          <p class="audioquote">"My parents were just in their late teens when someone knocked on their door." - Ruth Anne Whicher </p>
        </div>

        <p>Members are required to attend multiple weekly meetings, to study the Bible and various assigned publications, and to “evangelize actively among friends, neighbors, and strangers,” according to David Voas, a sociologist of religion at the University
          College London.  The weekly time commitment, which includes preaching, two meetings, meeting preparation, and other activities is around 10 hours for the average Jehovah’s Witness.</p>

          <p class="audioquote">"A weekly routine, monthly routine, daily routine never varied. My father was an elder in the congregation." - Ruth Anne Whicher </p>
        </div>
        <p>The witnesses believe that when people die, they simply return to the earth. Heaven is only for a select number, and there is no hell other than the grave. At a future date, God, called Jehovah, will destroy non-believers and the earth will be
          restored to the paradise Adam and Eve lost in the book of Genesis. The earth will be populated by Jehovah’s Witnesses whose bodies have been restored to perfection- no sickness, no death. They will live to time eternal.</p>

      <div class="bio">
        <p class="begbio">Ruth Anne, a writer from Nova Scotia, Canada, was born in the Jehovah’s Witnesses. Her parents converted before when they were newly married and her father quickly rose through the ranks to become an elder. Their family hosted weekly Bible studies
          in their home and religious activities filled their lives.</p>

        <p>But her family life transformed when she was a teenager and her father accepted a blood transfusion on behalf of his son and was disfellowshipped. Her mother continued as a witness, but her father never sought to be reinstated. Years later, when
          her father suddenly died, the Jehovah’s Witness elder that her father named to give his funeral sermon refused to speak at the funeral of a deceased disfellowshipped person. Another one of her brothers refused to attend the funeral. “Tell my
          mother I have lost nothing,” he said when he heard about his father’s death. One of Ruth Anne’s nieces and a nephew have committed suicide. The niece left a note, “I just wanted to be a normal girl.” </p>

        <p>When Ruth Anne’s father disfellowshipped, it was something of a release for her. She went to college and got married. She has a daughter with whom she shares a healthy relationship. She recently wrote a book about the murder and abduction of her
          childhood Jehovah’s Witness friend that upended her young life and indirectly led her to leave the organization. </p>

      </div> <span class="unsticky"></span>
    </div>
    <div class="story">
      <p>Waiting for life in the paradise, as witnesses call the earth’s future transformation, makes a mirage of life in this world. As they anticipate endless life under a theocracy, the notion of going to college or pursuing a career recedes into the
        background- a distracting distortion of the pursuits of “worldly people,” JW jargon for unbelievers. Though they maintain a respectful relationship with secular authority, congregation authority sometimes collides with the law in unexpected ways.</p>
      <p>When ex-JW Ruth Anne Whicher’s childhood friend, Georgia, went missing, her father, an elder in the congregation, led a squad of congregation members in search of the body. Six weeks later, a fellow Jehovah’s Witness was charged with Georgia’s rape
        and murder. During the search, Ruth Anne’s older brother got into a serious car accident and required a blood transfusion. </p>

      <p>Ruth Anne’s father saw his son near death, and made the difficult decision of going against JW doctrine by accepting a blood transfusion for his son. Instead of grappling with the repercussions of discovering a murderer and rapist in their midst,
        the congregation disfellowshipped Ruth Anne’s father.</p>

      <div class="bio">
        <p class="begbio">One day when Helen Travers was a child, a woman wearing pearls and a tweed suit came to her family farm. Her mother spoke with the woman, and soon thereafter, the woman returned. They poured pots and pots of tea while they studied the Jehovah’s
          Witness Bible, Helen recalled. When Helen was about 9 or ten years old, her mother told Helen and her siblings that she wanted them to study to join the Jehovah’s Witnesses. They all did.</p>

        <p>After marrying a man who introduced her to a new lifestyle that conflicted with the religion, Helen felt she needed to make a choice. She had begun drinking and going to nightclubs when she usually would have been at the Kingdom Hall or evangelizing.
          She was consumed with guilt and stopped practicing altogether. Then, she and her husband fell on difficult financial times. “Look you’re sitting on a gold mine. You can earn money with sex. You can earn more in a day than you’d earn in a week,”
          he told her one day. Helen began working as a prostitute, which she did for the next year. She attempt suicide multiple times because of the weight of her guilt. </p>

        <p>In the mid 80s, Helen met a former Jehovah’s Witness through a mutual friend. “In the first 15 minutes of speaking to her, she cleared my head. I think I was ready to find out it wasn’t the truth,” said Helen. She felt released from years of guilt
          and low self esteem. </p>

        <p>After her father, who was not a Jehovah’s Witness, passed away, Helen’s mother shunned her for twelve years. But when her mother suffered a stroke, their relationship warmed up. Today, Helen enjoys a cordial relationship with most of her family
          members. </p>

      <span class="unsticky"></span>
    </div>
    <div class="story">
      <p>After Helen left the Jehovah’s Witnesses when she was nineteen, she married a man who controlled and physically abused her. He was bad with money and convinced Travers to work as a prostitute to make ends meet. She was consumed by guilt. </p>

      <p>Helen’s father, who wasn’t a witness, was the glue that kept her connected to the family. After he died, Helen offended her Jehovah’s Witness mother with a flippant remark about JW doctrine. Soon after the incident, Helen’s mother mailed her a letter
        stating that she would no longer be in contact.</p>

      <p>If a Jehovah’s Witness commits what is deemed “a serious sin” and does not express sufficient repentance, they are to be excommunicated, according to an article published in the August 2015 Watchtower magazine. The article, which calls disfellowshipping
        “a loving provision” offers the most recent explanation of the practice, which was instituted in 1952.  </p>

      <p>Serious sins include engaging in premarital sex, smoking cigarettes, and marital infidelity, but there is no exhaustive list. Offenses encompass acts that range from watching pornography to getting a tattoo. </p>
      <p>When a person has confessed the act, but does not appear to be sufficiently repentant- a subjective process, up to the discernment of congregation elders-the person is then disfellowshipped. </p>
      <h2>AT HOME AND DISFELLOWSHIPPED</h2>
      <p>If an adult is disfellowshipped, the repercussions are straightforward. But when a young person who still lives with parents is excommunicated, the family often ends up dancing an invisible line drawn between the rooms of the family home, around
        the dining table, in the hallways. The intention is to make to the offending person feel shame, but the rituals of family life and the practicalities of living under the same roof complicate the mission. </p>
      <p> “Even though the relationship isn’t there, you still remain polite. If a loved one dies, for instance, you’d still give your condolences,” said a member from a congregation in Far Rockaway who asked to remain anonymous.</p>

      <p>But when she was asked about what it’s like when someone who lives in the family home is disfellowshipped, she referred to to articles on jw.org, the official website of Jehovah’s Witnesses. </p>

      <p>“It’s not like there’s walls up and you completely shut the person out,” she finally said, when pressed for more details. Perhaps it was the bitter cold weather- though we were standing in an enclosed subway station- but her eyes looked like they
        had filled with tears. Appearing desperate for a way to end the conversation, she quickly excused herself saying she was going on a break. </p>

      <p>When Debbie Dupuis was invited to go for ice cream, her mother refused to let her go because the invitation was from an unbeliever. Debbie snapped. All the years of having her life micromanaged by the organization flashed before her “in an instant,”
        Debbie said. </p>

      <p>“Well I’m not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,” she told her mother before leaving with her friend. </p>

      <p>Her mother heard the statement as a battle cry. She alerted Debbie’s father. When Debbie returned home that evening, a group of congregation elders was waiting for her. They used scriptures to try to bring Debbie back to her senses, but to no avail.
        Her mind was made up.</p>

      <p>Soon after, she was disfellowshipped. Debbie’s mother beat her younger sister who was 11 years old for sneaking into Debbie’s room to speak to her. </p>

      <div class="bio">
        <p class="begbio">Violeta Dias, 32, was born into a Jehovah’s Witness family in Santiago, Chile and she enjoyed their life together, along with her younger brother. Growing up, she liked going to the congregations meetings, “sitting and listening, taking notes,”
          she recalled. She also loved traveling around Chile to engage in Jehovah’s Witness activities. Her mother had five sisters who were special pioneers who lived in different towns around Chile, so Violeta got to visit them and preach in different
          locations. The fact that her mother’s only siblings were special pioneers is also why Violeta had no cousins, she said. Her aunts had opted to forgo having families to devote themselves to preaching, a common practice among witnesses who seek
          greater responsibility in the organization. The only downside of her childhood was being bullied in school, but the bullying made her feel even more proud to be a Jehovah’s Witness. </p>

        <p>Despite her family’s deep involvement, Violeta ended up going to university full time. She loved it. It was her first time feeling completely accepted by her peers while being a proud Jehovah’s Witness. Then she fell in love with a non-believer.
          Violeta was disfellowshipped while still living at home. She soon moved out of her family home, which felt like a relief.</p>

        <p>It took a few years before Violeta felt that her belief system came undone. “I had to go through a lot of work. Therapy has been crucial to my healing process,” she said. While her family initially maintained some contact, two years ago her mother
          sent a text saying that they could no longer be in touch. “It’s pain and grief that’s inside me all the time. I just learn to live with it. It’s always there.”</p>

          "Even the not-so-nice memories have their nice part which was having the support of my family" - Violeta Rios Dias
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>“I wasn’t one of those Jehovah’s Witnesses whose parents didn’t let them go to college. My parents valued education,” she said from her office in Santiago, Chile, where she works as a research and development engineer. </p>

      <p>She remembers a childhood traveling around Chile preaching with her aunts and uncles who were special pioneers, as people who spend 130 hours or more evangelizing are called.</p>

      <p>But during her first year of college, when she still lived in the family home, Violeta fell in love with a non- Jehovah’s Witness classmate. </p>

      <p>For Jehovah’s Witnesses, dating isn’t a “swipe right” situation. It’s a precursor to marriage and should only be done with vows in mind. Dating outside of the organization is forbidden. Furthermore, when a Jehovah’s Witness couple dates, they are
        to be accompanied by a chaperone.
      </p>

      <p>On a Skype call last month, Violeta recalled the first kiss she shared with her college boyfriend. “It was supposed to be a beautiful experience, but I felt so guilty,” she said. </p>

      <p>As a matter of fact, for Violeta, their entire time dating was marred by a sinking feeling of doom mixed with self loathing. She was living a double life, hiding their relationship from her parents. When she spent nights with him, she told her parents
        she was with a Jehovah’s Witness friend. When another Jehovah’s Witness saw Violeta with her boyfriend, he gave her two months to come clean.

      <p>When she confessed to the elders in the congregation, the judiciary committee decided to disfellowship her. Because she still lived with her parents, the family was in a precarious situation. As a disfellowshipped family member, relatives who lived
        in the home would be permitted to speak with her but other things would be limited.</p>

          "This is it, we have to be ready, Armageddon's going to come." - Mona Miller </p>
      </div>


      <p>Growing up in eastern Oregon, Mona Miller wondered why people who seemed like otherwise good people, but who weren’t believers were going to die in Armageddon. </p>

      <p>After her father died when she was a teenager, she began working at a grocery store to help support her mother. While she pioneered at intervals and worked part time, she was constantly reprimanded by elders for working on nights when she was supposed
        to be at Kingdom Hall meetings.</p>

      <p>When Mona was 24, a man in a cowboy hat came to the grocery store where she worked and a casual flirtation ensued. After eight months of only seeing each other in the grocery store, the man came to Mona’s house and formally asked permission to date
        her. Mona’s mother couldn’t allow her to date anyone who wasn’t a witness, but then they came up with an idea. What if the man studied to become a Jehovah’s Witness? </p>

      <p>Mona was allowed to date him under this guise. Mona’s mother accompanied them as a chaperone on their dates, but congregation elders found the relationship inappropriate. One day, they brought Mona in to be reprimanded and threatened to disfellowship
        her if the relationship continued. Mona knew she had committed no sin because all of her dates were chaperoned. Dreading the shame disfellowshipping would cause her mother, Mona drove to a cliff and contemplated suicide. </p>

      <p>But her mother wrote a letter to headquarters asking about Mona’s case. A few weeks later, she got a reply saying that Mona had not committed a disfellowshipping offense. But the whole ordeal poked holes in Mona’s faith and she stopped going to
        meetings. Soon after, her brother told her he could no longer speak to her.</p>

      <p>Dan Adams was sitting in his car when he caught sight of his two daughters. It was his first time seeing them in six years. The occasion was his mother’s funeral. Instead of jumping out of the car from behind the driver’s seat where he was dozing
        off, he watched from a distance and marveled at “how old they looked.” They had emailed him a few days earlier asking that he not try to speak to them. </p>

      <div class="bio">
        <p class="begbio">Dan Adams grew up in a small town just west of Walkill, NY, where one of the two properties called the Watchtower Farm is located. Though he had plenty exposure to the religion, he didn’t join until he went to his Jehovah’s Witness brother’s wedding
          and was completely “love bombed by the witnesses,” he said. It was 1980 and he was in his first year of college. He converted within six months. He dropped out of college because the witnesses didn’t encourage higher education and he stopped
          teaching karate, a hobby he’d had since he was a child. </p>

        <p>Dan climbed through the ranks and became an elder. He, his wife, and three children were a model Jehovah’s Witness family. But he was disturbed by things he saw behind the scenes as an elder. “What witnesses are taught from the platform is different
          from what we saw as elders,” he said. He can’t name one particular instance that led to his leaving after 27 years as a witness, he says. His exit was more like a series of cumulative moments that gradually erupted.</p>

        <p>He eventually started to drift away from meetings, and it strained his marriage. He got a divorce and moved from San Diego to Seattle. He needed a new start because everyone he knew from the Kingdom Hall began to shun him and there was a complete
          cut off from his family. When his mother died a year and half ago, he was shunned by his entire family at the funeral. </p>

        <p>Starting a retirement fund was a landmark moment of his new life. “Just knowing that there’s not some mystical force guiding my life and protecting me. I’m taking care of Dan now,” he said with a tone of simple contentment, albeit one tinged with
          grief. </p>

        <p>Last year, he married another ex-Jehovah’s Witness who he met in an online JW recovery group named Amy. </p>

    <div class="story">
      <p>Dan decided to leave the organization after witnessing things that disturbed him when he was an elder, like the congregation not warning families when they had reasonable evidence that a member has sexually abused children.  </p>

      </div>

      <p>Then Dan started listening to a radio program hosted by magician and supernatural myth buster, James Randi, which awakened his skepticism. The more he realized how valuable skepticism was, the more he was forced to look at his own religion. </p>

      <p>“It wasn’t until I allowed myself to ask questions about what I was teaching and what I was learning that I started to see that it didn’t sit right with me,” he said.  </p>

      <p>The day he saw his daughters from inside his car at his mother’s funeral was his last time at a Kingdom Hall. No one spoke to him while he was in the building. He sat against the wall away from his family listening to the sermon about his mother
        being resurrected to a paradise, where he would, presumably, not be.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Disfellowshipping among Jehovah’s Witnesses is a means to maintain a strong sense of membership, according to religious sociologists, Rodney Stark and Laurence Iannaccone.</p>

      <p>In their 1997 paper, “Why The Jehovah’s Witnesses Grow So Rapidly: A Theoretical Application,” published in the Journal of Contemporary Religion, they praise Jehovah’s Witnesses as “the fastest growing sect in the world.” </p>

      <p>Their projections for the growth rate of Jehovah’s Witnesses were later discredited, but their research on what they call “the success of the organization” is still largely cited among religious studies scholars. They attribute the growth of the
        organization, in part, to the practice of disfellowshipping.</p>

      <p>Stark and Iannoccone argue that if an organization is strict, it increases the value of membership by weeding out “free-loaders,” their term for people who do not fulfill their share of the work membership requires. Disfellowshipping creates a sense
        of solidarity and members know that their commitment has value, they state.  </p>

      <p>But it is not only people who do not carry out their share of the required ministry who are shunned.</p>

      <p>Karen Wilson, 55, from Spokane Washington, was a pioneer, a Jehovah’s Witness who does the preaching work full-time, when she was disfellowshipped. Wilson was physically abused by her husband. When she went to the elders, instead of the police,
        she was told that she should be a more “submissive” wife.</p>

      <p>“A light bulb went off in my head. Why would God have created me, if I was only supposed to be beaten up by my husband?”, said Wilson.</p>

      <p>Wilson was an active and devoted Jehovah’s Witness who shunned her mother because it was mandated by the organization, yet she was not protected from shunning when she escaped an abusive spouse.</p>

      <p>“Since I was 17 I have had a parent out of my life due to shunning. First I shunned my mom. Then my dad has shunned me since I left,” she said.</p>

      <p>Cheryl Ching, a family therapist and licensed social worker based in Brooklyn, bases her philosophy, in part, on the idea that “family is connected even if there is a disconnect. There is a kind of continuing influence, whether the people are there
        in front of them or not.” </p>
      <h1>THE GRAY AREA</h1>
      <p> Another truism is that shunning happens on a spectrum. The organization may mandate that family members and friends cut off communication, but individual members sometimes choose to speak to their loved one who is disfellowshipped in small amounts.
      </p>

      <p>The underlying fear of witnesses, though, is that by speaking to the disfellowshipped person, the believer may be punished. Choosing to speak to a disfellowshipped person is complicated. And sometimes, even after years of being in contact with an
        ex-Jehovah’s Witness, a person may choose to suddenly withdraw contact altogether.</p>

      <p>A discourse given at the 2017 three-day Jehovah’s Witness convention announced that even if a person is not disfellowshipped, if he/she no longer attends meetings, the person should be shunned.</p>

      <p>Chayla Gibson’s parents who had spoken to her everyday for ten years even after she stopped attending meetings heard the discourse at the Cow Palace in San Francisco. Within a month, they visited Chayla and told her that they could no longer speak
        to her. </p>

        <p class="begbio">Chayla Gibson had an ideal upbringing as a Jehovah’s Witness- loving parents, a dog, camping trips, and plenty of religious activity. She had no doubts about the faith. But when she was around 30-years-old, she couldn’t ignore certain things that
          struck her as red flags. “I just couldn’t understand why we weren’t allowed to research things. If it was “the truth” then why couldn’t I read things and come to that conclusion on my own?” she said. </p>

        <p>When she decided to leave, she talked to her two sons about the new direction their life would take. The boys, who were 8 and ten years old both cried. “I had indoctrinated them so much that they thought that we were going to die and be destroyed.”
          Even though they were still very close to their grandparents who were Jehovah’s Witness, they eventually appreciated their mother’s choice. They enjoyed things that they wouldn’t have been permitted to do as witnesses like play sports on a school
          team and celebrate the holidays. </p>

        <p>Because she wasn’t disfellowshipped, Chayla maintained contact with her parents speaking to them everyday for almost six years since she stopped attending meetings. But after a new directive that asks families to shun members who have faded as
          if they were disfellowshipped, her parents decided to cut contact. They also lost contact with their grandchildren.</p>

        <p>Though she doesn’t practice a particular faith, spirituality is important to her. She keeps an open dialogue about spirituality with her sons encourages them to ask questions. </p>

      <p> Andrea Rota, a professor in the Sociology of Religion at The Universities of Bern and Fribourg in Switzerland, whose research focuses on Jehovah’s Witnesses, does not like to use the term “controlling” when discussing the influence the organization
        exerts on members’ lives. </p>

      <p>“When you say control, it negates the fact that many witnesses choose to stay and are quite happy with the sect,” he said. </p>

      <p>Rota pointed out that there are Jehovah’s Witnesses who practice while maintaining a sense of freedom to do as they choose in the privacy of their homes, even if their actions violate religious rules. </p>

      <p>“I know Jehovah’s Witnesses who are faithful, but they may choose to watch an “R” rated movie at home, but they won’t talk about it with other witnesses,” Rota said. </p>

      <p>Rota thinks the disparity is not unique and likens it to a commitment that one may make to an institution without personally enjoying all aspects of the commitment.</p>
      <p>A 25-year-old Jehovah’s Witness from South Carolina, who chose to remain anonymous, agreed. “You just do what you have to do. I don’t think having a tattoo is wrong, but I’d cover it when I go to the [Kingdom] hall,” she said.</p>

      <p>But to Chayla, her parents shun her because they feel obligated to. </p>

        <p>Steven Hassan, a mental health counselor who specializes in mind control, coined BITE, an acronym to describe the ways organizations control members. Julia Gutsell, a criminology researcher based in the UK, applied Hassan’s research to Jehovah’s
          Witnesses in a paper called “A Loving Provision- How Former Jehovah’s Witnesses Experience Shunning Practices.”</p>

        <p>BITE stands for behavioral, informational, thought, and emotional control. Witnesses, according to Gutsell, fit the bill for each mode. The organization controls behavior by regulating relationships, among other things, she says. Information control
          starts during recruitment by “withholding or distorting information about the group.” Members are also discouraged from seeking outside information, and peer-to-peer surveillance is encouraged. Thought control happens by promoting the underlying
          notion that the group possesses the ultimate truth and by providing simple answers to complex questions. Jehovah’s Witnesses commonly call doctrine “the truth.” Finally, emotional control takes place by frequently asking members to consider
          how “sinful” actions “would make Jehovah feel.” Guilt, shame, and fear are constantly called to mind in weekly sermons that remind members that they are sinners and “good for nothing slaves.” </p>

        <p class="begbio">Matthew Fudge dealt with anger over being disfellowshipped for years.The last time he attended a meeting at a Kingdom Hall, he wore blue jeans, a white t-shirt, and a leather jacket. He was disfellowshipped, so he sat in the back. </p>

        <p>“I didn’t deserve that. I didn’t deserve to be shunned,” he said. </p>

        <p>Matthew, 49, was born into the religion and was baptized when he was 15-years-old. His parents never told him to think about his decision to get baptized because they were just so happy that he wanted to commit his life to the Jehovah’s Witnesses.
        </p>

        <p>“If anyone wants to join that religion, I’d say you’re free to make your own decisions, but there’s a lot of heartache on the other side of that door if you choose to leave,” he said. </p>

        <p>When he got older, he confessed to being intimate with a woman which led to his being publicly reproved. The second time it happened, he was disfellowshipped. Though he was disfellowshipped, he had not actually had intercourse. He was 26 years
          old. </p>

        <p>Then, a co-worker who was raised as a Jehovah’s Witness began to go to church. And another one of his co-workers asked him to be in gospel play that she was directing. But Matthew still lived at home with his mother and she required him to attend
          congregation meetings in order to stay in her home. He started telling her that he was attending meetings in another congregation when he was actually going to church. Realizing that she deserved to know, he eventually told his mother the truth.</p>

        <p>“The relationship with my mother just deteriorated,” he said. He also lost a relationship with his brother, who is still a witness.</p>

        <p>Today, Matthew lives in New Jersey where he still sings on the choir and attends church every Sunday.</p>

      <p>Matthew was raised as a Jehovah’s Witness, but he found that by the time he was in his twenties, he couldn’t quell his curiosity about church. As a witness, churches are forbidden parts of “Christendom,” a JW catch-all word for Christian denominations.
        Compared to churches in the African American tradition, in particular, Kingdom Halls are somber places. Songs are sung to pre-recorded music with no percussion. Attendees sing in unison; there is no choir and there are no solos. Members stand
        at their seats to sing and quietly sit when the songs, known as kingdom melodies, are over. </p>

      <p>Matthew took his questions about church to two women co-workers. One of them told him she was directing a gospel play and asked Matthew to audition. As a child, Matthew would have never imagined that one day he would be in a church, or performing
        in a gospel play, no less. </p>

      <p>“I was good at it!” he said, reliving the initial joy almost 20 years later. </p>

      <p>A few months after acting in the gospel play, he stopped attending the Kingdom Hall.</p>

      <p>“God called me out of it,” he told his Jehovah’s Witness mother, after months of going to a church without telling her.   </p>

      </div>
      <p>When his mother began to suffer with dementia, Matthew was stricken with the urgency to repair their damaged relationship. One Sunday when Matthew didn’t go to church, he decided to go to the Kingdom Hall to check on his mother. His plan was to
        find an elder and say, “Can you tell me how my mother’s doing?” He ended up seeing his mother first. She was standing by another woman, close to her age, Matthew recalled. When the woman realized who Matthew was, she stared at him with a look
        of contempt so vile that he felt like “filth or gum under a shoe,” he said, while his mother watched. Within moments, his mother began to weep, begging him to return to Jehovah.

      <div class="bio">
        <p class="begbio">Leon Cowan remembers waking up early to go to Jehovah’s Witness conventions at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles. He and his father would save seats for the family by flanking magazines and brochures published by the witnesses over the edge of the
          folded seats. </p>

        <p>Leon believed almost immediately. “There wasn’t a time in my childhood or early adulthood that I didn’t think that this was absolutely true.” </p>

        <p>To his parents, insulation was an important part of the faith. “The worst JW is still better than the best person on the outside,” his mother would frequently say. </p>

        <p>When he was disfellowshipped the first time, he did everything to get back in. His father was an elder and his mother was a pioneer and he didn’t want them to be shamed by his actions. He was reinstated within a year. The second time he was disfellowshipped,
          he decided to take his time to return. </p>

        <p>He didn’t realize it, but his belief in the doctrine had slowly begun to crumble. “I began to believe things like evolution but I would rationalize it and say ‘You know maybe they just don’t realize God also uses evolution,” he said.</p>

        <p>But when he met his wife, she challenged his beliefs in ways he couldn’t refute. She attended a few meetings and even studied the Bible with a witness to try and learn more about her boyfriend’s faith but, to her, the doctrine didn’t hold up.
        </p>

        <p>After they were married, Leon decided to make a serious effort to return. He figured that he would ask all of the questions that had built up in the ten years that he had been disfellowshipped, but none of it made sense anymore. Despite the emotional
          rollercoaster of dismantling the only belief system he has ever known, he feels better just knowing “the actual truth,” he said.</p>

      <h1>RECOVERY</h1>
      <p>Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005 when Karama Sadaka was 30-years-old. Completely disoriented, he feared that he was on the wrong side of the war he been raised to believe would end the world.</p>

      <p>He wandered around New Orleans until FEMA relocated him to Nashville. Away from New Orleans and the only religion he had ever known, he saw an opportunity to start fresh. </p>

      <p>“There were so many things I had to learn about the world. Sometimes I feel like I’m a baby,” said Sadaka. </p>

      <p>After a stint in Nashville, he moved to New York City where he eventually got involved in an ex-Jehovah’s Witness recovery group, founded by Ruben Ortiz. </p>

      <p>Sadaka remembers the promise of seeing his father again in paradise, but he’s worked hard to reprogram his thoughts. He still deals with anger and forgiveness, but he’s channeled his emotions into helping free people from what he calls “the mind
        control of the witnesses.” </p>

        <p class="begbio">Amneris Cruz, a massage therapist from Puerto Rico, was six years old when her mother started to attend Jehovah’s Witness meetings. Her family didn’t have a car and the woman who gave them rides to school and work was a witness. When Amneris’
          mother began to go to meetings with the woman, she was smitten by how kindly members treated her. But when Amneris went, something didn’t seem right to her. </p>

        <p>“I always thought it didn’t make sense. But I didn’t say anything because I was too shy,” she said.</p>

        <p>Around the same time, Amneris’ father began to sexually abuse her. “I still have to have my door closed to sleep. I still have fears. I had nightmares for years,” Amneris said.</p>

        <p>One day when she was 16-years-old, her mother asked if her father ever touched her. Amneris panicked, but she finally told. She found out later that her mother knew her father had a problem. He had been arrested and put on trial for abusing other
          children when Amneris was four-years-old, but had been released. </p>

        <p>Amneris thought that things would change when her mother found out about the abuse. Other children in the Kingdom Hall had also told the elders about her father’s abuse. One woman called Amneris years later to tell her that Amneris’ father had
          raped her. A Jehovah’s Witness rule, however, requires two witnesses to be present for abuse to be verified. </p>

        <p>Amneris got married and had two children, both of whom were born with developmental disorders. Amneris’ new family moved to Indiana, along with her mother, brothers, and sisters-in-law. Her husband left the family soon after. Amneris couldn’t
          deny that she no longer wanted to be a Jehovah’s Witness. Amneris eventually joined a JW recovery group. She built a career as a massage therapist and moved to New York City.</p>

      <p>Some former Jehovah’s Witnesses opt to return their family’s shunning by not accepting occasional phone calls or otherwise cold treatment.</p>

      <p>Cheryl Ching, the therapist in Brooklyn, says that her process with each client is based on how the individual defines the relationship, i.e, do they sense a lack? Do they want their family back in their life? </p>

      <p>“It’s important to feel that sense of power, that it is possible to have a relationship that’s based on your terms,” Ching says.  In other words, it’s important to for the person to feel that they’re not always a victim of the group, at the mercy
        of the damaging system.  </p>

      <p>For Amneris Cruz, a 44-year-old former Jehovah’s Witness from Puerto Rico, recovery is a line in the sand drawn by her own hand.</p>

      </div>

      <p>Cruz was sexually abused by her father, a Jehovah’s Witness, from the time she was 6 to 16 years old. When it came out that her father had abused 15 other girls, the congregation excused his actions and he was unpunished. </p>

      <p>“I never could do a double life. I didn’t believe everything, but I couldn’t leave because my family was in,” said Cruz. </p>

      <p>After the family moved to Indiana from Puerto Rico, Amneris continued practicing, but she couldn’t get over the hypocrisy she saw. She also never forgave her family, particularly her mother, for not taking action when they found out she was being
        sexually abused. Amneris noticed the ways her mother blamed her for her father’s abuse. Even so, she feared losing the relationship she shared with her brothers and their wives. It was the same push and pull that Mona Miller had felt: the nagging
        doubts that shoved their way into her dreams and waking life, coupled with the familiar pull of cordial family relationships. </p>

      <p>In the end, the doubts won. Once she stopped practicing, Cruz’s mother and brothers stopping speaking to her. Cruz barely spoke English and she didn’t know anyone in the states. </p>

      <p>Since Jehovah’s Witnesses do not encourage going to college, Cruz found herself unable to find a job and with no marketable skills. The isolation of being on the inside of the organization was not dissimilar to what she felt on the outside, but
        her determination to start a new life spurred her. She eventually became a certified massage therapist and fell in love with Ruben Ortiz, the founder of ex-Jehovah’s Witness Recovery 3, the largest JW recovery group on Facebook. </p>

      <p>Mercedes Varas, a 30-year-old from Miami, only realized the ways she had been impacted by her upbringing as a Jehovah’s Witness years after she left.</p>

          "I just realized I wasn't OK." - Mercedes Varas </p>
      </div>


      <p>Like Debbie Dupuis, Mercedes’ doubts about the religion began early. She was baptized when she was 9 years old. By the time she was 14, Mercedes started being homeschooled, which allows young people to pioneer, a choice common among Jehovah’s Witnesses.
        Her mother imagined that Mercedes was on a spiritual track to Bethel, but Mercedes was leading a “double life.” </p>

      <p>She had romantic feelings for another girl in the Kingdom Hall. She began visiting chat rooms.</p>

      <p>“I started to feel like there was a struggle in me. Like there was something more out there for me,” she said.</p>

      <p>She ended up getting involved with a man she met online almost 10 years older than she was. She tried to end the relationship when she realized “it was toxic and he was controlling,” she said.</p>

      <p>But then he showed up to her Kingdom Hall pretending to be interested in becoming a witness, a move that earned him the blessings of her mother and congregation elders. Then, he got verbally abusive and began following her everywhere. She had nowhere
        to turn. </p>

      <p>The man told Mercedes that he wanted to officially become a witness by getting baptized but he needed to confess to the elders that he and Mercedes had slept together. </p>

          "Instead of people protecting me, the person who got disfellowshipped was me." - Mercedes Varas </p>
      </div>

      <p>After the confession, Mercedes was disfellowshipped. The shunning put Mercedes on the brink of an emotional collapse. The man began spreading rumors about Mercedes in the Kingdom Hall. When Mercedes complained that she was being harassed, “the basic
        attitude was ‘what did you expect? That’s what you get for having sex,’” she said. </p>

          "I started cutting myself. I started toying with the idea of suicide." - Mercedes Varas</p>
      </div>

      <p>After she was reinstated, she moved from her mother’s house and began to fade. But she felt afraid for years, wondering “What if this really is the truth?” </p>

      <p>She started to date an English professor who inspired her to travel and challenged her old beliefs. After beginning therapy, she realized that helping someone else would aid her recovery.</p>

      <p>She formed a meetup group for former Jehovah’s Witnesses in Miami. </p>

      <p>“The only encouragement there is to think for yourself. Find your own voice,” she said of the group’s philosophy.</p>
      <h1>THE WAY FORWARD</h1>
      <p> One chilly fall day in a suburb of Boston, Karen Wilson hosted a workshop for victims of spiritual abuse. She had taped large sheets of easel paper on the walls of the meeting room adjoined to a church where the workshop was being held. The sheets
        had information on the ways religious groups control members and blank spaces for participants to write in their experiences. No participants were former Jehovah’s Witnesses, but Karen recognized the similarities in her own experience- emotional
        control, shunning, physical abuse, among other tell-tale signs. </p>

      <p>“Recovery is a process. It happens bit by bit,” she said. </p>

      <p>Former Jehovah’s Witnesses have carved out roads to recovery from the psychological damage of being in the organization. Social media groups and websites dedicated to helping ex Jehovah’s Witnesses can be found all over the internet, buzzing with
        heart wrenching stories of families torn apart and users offering words of encouragement to each other.</p>

      <p>There are also stories of joy. This year, Deb D’Agostino’s mother, a 99-year-old Jehovah’s Witness, decided to celebrate her birthday for the first time. </p>

      <p>Karen Wilson now enjoys a rich relationship with her mother, who she shunned for almost ten years. </p>

      <p>Like so many victims of systemic trauma, they had chosen paths - treacherous, winding, and unpredictable- to recovery. And somewhere on the way, they chose to speak out. </p>

            <h1>Disfellowshipping</h1>
            <p>If a Jehovah’s Witness commits what is deemed “a serious sin” and does not express enough repentance, they are to be excommunicated, according to an article published in the August 2015 Watchtower magazine. The article, which calls disfellowshipping
              “a loving provision” offers the most recent explanation of the practice, which was instituted in 1952. </p>
